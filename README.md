# Web Scraping Tutorial üï∑Ô∏èüìä

Welcome to the Web Scraping Tutorial repository! This guide is designed for those who want to learn web scraping from the ground up. Before diving in, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of Python, including loops, conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`), variables, and containers. If you're not familiar with these concepts, don't worry! You can get up to speed with my [Basic Python Repository](https://github.com/durjoy5327/Python-Basic-and-DSA-Python-/tree/main/Python%20Basic).

## Prerequisites üìö

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to install the following Python libraries:
<ul>
  <li>requests</li>
  <li>beautifulsoup4</li>
  <li>pandas</li>
  <li>selenium</li>
</ul>

You can install them using <code>pip</code>:
<pre><code>pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas</code></pre>

### Additional Tools üõ†Ô∏è
In addition to the above libraries, you will also need to install:
- **WebDriver**: This is necessary to control web browsers for web scraping using Selenium. The WebDriver must match the version of the web browser you're using (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome).

#### Setting Up Selenium and WebDriver
1. **Install WebDriver**:
   - For Chrome, download [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) and ensure it matches your Chrome version.
   - For Firefox, download [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) if you're using Firefox.
  
2. **Add WebDriver to Your PATH**:
   - After downloading the appropriate WebDriver, make sure to add it to your system's PATH environment variable. This allows your system to recognize `chromedriver` or `geckodriver` commands from any directory.

## What You'll Learn üéì

In this repository, we will cover:
<ul>
  <li>The basics of web scraping</li>
  <li>How to pull data from websites</li>
