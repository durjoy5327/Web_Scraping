# Web Scraping Tutorial 🕷️📊

Welcome to the Web Scraping Tutorial repository! This guide is designed for those who want to learn web scraping from the ground up. Before diving in, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of Python, including loops, conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`), variables, and containers. If you're not familiar with these concepts, don't worry! You can get up to speed with my [Basic Python Repository](https://github.com/durjoy5327/Python-Basic-and-DSA-Python-/tree/main/Python%20Basic).

## Prerequisites 📚

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to install the following Python libraries:
<ul>
  <li>requests</li>
  <li>beautifulsoup4</li>
  <li>pandas</li>
  <li>selenium</li>
</ul>

You can install them using <code>pip</code>:
<pre><code>pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas</code></pre>
<pre><code>pip install selenium==4.0.0.b4</code></pre>
### Additional Tools 🛠️
In addition to the above libraries, you will also need to install:
- **WebDriver**: This is necessary to control web browsers for web scraping using Selenium. The WebDriver must match the version of the web browser you're using (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome).

<h3>⬇️ Download ChromeDriver</h3>
<p>Download the version of ChromeDriver that matches your installed Chrome browser version from the official site:</p>
<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/downloads">🌐 ChromeDriver Downloads</a></p>

<p>After downloading, extract the executable and place it in a known directory, then update the <code>path</code> variable in the script to point to the ChromeDriver executable.</p>

## What You'll Learn 🎓

In this repository, we will cover:
<ul>
  <li>The basics of web scraping</li>
  <li>How to pull data from websites</li>
  <li>How to save the scraped data into Excel sheets</li>
</ul>

## Project Overview 🚀
